# Golf-Tournament-QAP
This project allows a user to add new  members to a golf club and tournament details to a database using an API, as well as add members to a golf tournament. The program also has 9 different search functionalities. Two of these searches are for finding all members or tournaments in the database. In addition, users can search for members using either their name, phone number, or receive a list of members participating in a specific tournament start date. Users are also able to search tournaments using the tournament start date, the location, and be able to receive a list of all the members participating in a specific tournament. To run the project in docker, simply type docker compose up in the terminal. I couldn't get my branches to merge with the main branch, it kept saying .
